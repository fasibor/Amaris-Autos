## Key Findings

1. **Diesel Cars**: Toyota is the most affordable diesel brand, while Ford is the most expensive. Newer models (2018â€“2023) and larger engines (4-5L) command higher prices. Diesel cars with 2-4 previous owners are cheaper, while those with 1 or 5 owners are more expensive. Semi-automatic diesel cars are among the most budget-friendly, especially for low-mileage options, with Audi and BMW offering the best deals.  
2. **Electric Cars**: Honda is the most affordable electric brand, whereas Ford is the most expensive. Older models (pre-2017) and smaller engines (1-2L) offer better value. Semi-automatic electric cars are the cheapest, while automatic ones cost the most. Vehicles with 1, 3, or 4 previous owners are more affordable. Toyota provides the most budget-friendly low-mileage electric cars, while Honda has the highest mileage in this category.  
3. **Hybrid Cars**: Kia is the most affordable hybrid brand, while Audi is the most expensive. Older models (pre-2018) and smaller engines (1-2L) offer better value. Manual hybrids are the cheapest, whereas automatic hybrids are the most expensive. Cars with 2-4 previous owners tend to be more budget-friendly. Volkswagen offers the most affordable low-mileage hybrid cars.  
4. **Petrol Cars**: Mercedes is the most affordable petrol brand, while Volkswagen is the most expensive. Older models and smaller engines (1-2L) provide the best value. Semi-automatic petrol cars are the most budget-friendly, while automatic cars are the most expensive. Vehicles with multiple previous owners tend to be cheaper, but those with only one owner remain costly. Honda is the best option for low-mileage petrol cars, whereas Ford ranks the lowest in this category.

## Actionable Recommendations

1. **Promote Affordable Diesel and Petrol Options**: Since Toyota (diesel) and Mercedes (petrol) are the most budget-friendly brands, dealerships should highlight these options in marketing campaigns targeting cost-conscious buyers.  
2. **Optimize Inventory for Hybrid and Electric Vehicles**: Stock more Kia and Hyundai hybrids for affordability and emphasize Toyotaâ€™s lower-mileage electric models to appeal to buyers looking for EVs with reduced wear.  
3. **Encourage Purchases of Older Models**: Since older models (pre-2018 for diesel, hybrid, and petrol, and pre-2017 for electric) offer better value, dealerships can create targeted promotions, trade-in programs, and financing deals for these cars.  
4. **Educate Buyers on Transmission Choices**: Given that semi-automatic and manual transmissions offer better affordability across fuel types, dealerships should provide educational content on cost-benefit comparisons to influence customer decisions.
